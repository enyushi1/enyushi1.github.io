excerpt: "We give a comprehensive tutorial overview on near-field XL-MIMO communications, aiming to provide useful guidance for tackling the above challenges. First, the basic near-field modelling for XL-MIMO is established, by considering the new characteristics of non-uniform spherical wave (NUSW) and spatial non-stationarity. Next, based on the near-field modelling, the performance analysis of XL-MIMO is presented, including the near-field signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scaling laws, beam focusing pattern, achievable rate, and degrees-of-freedom (DoF). Furthermore, various XL-MIMO design issues such as near-field beam codebook, beam training, channel estimation, and delay alignment modulation (DAM) transmission are elaborated. Finally, we point out promising directions to inspire future research on near-field XL-MIMO communications."

**Abstract**: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is a promising technology for the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks. By significantly boosting the antenna number or size to at least an order of magnitude beyond current massive MIMO systems, XL-MIMO is expected to unprecedentedly enhance the spectral efficiency and spatial resolution for wireless communication. The evolution from massive MIMO to XL-MIMO is not simply an increase in the array size, but faces new design challenges, in terms of near-field channel modelling, performance analysis, channel estimation, and practical implementation. In this article, we give a comprehensive tutorial overview on near-field XL-MIMO communications, aiming to provide useful guidance for tackling the above challenges. First, the basic near-field modelling for XL-MIMO is established, by considering the new characteristics of non-uniform spherical wave (NUSW) and spatial non-stationarity. Next, based on the near-field modelling, the performance analysis of XL-MIMO is presented, including the near-field signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scaling laws, beam focusing pattern, achievable rate, and degrees-of-freedom (DoF). Furthermore, various XL-MIMO design issues such as near-field beam codebook, beam training, channel estimation, and delay alignment modulation (DAM) transmission are elaborated. Finally, we point out promising directions to inspire future research on near-field XL-MIMO communications.
